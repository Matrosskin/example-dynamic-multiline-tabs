# example-dynamic-multiline-tabs

[Demo](https://matrosskin.github.io/example-dynamic-multiline-tabs/)

At demo used 3 solutions:
 - inline + float
 - flex
 - grid (with hardcoded areas for content blocks)

With grid solution, to omit hardcoding, can be used solution similar to used with flex (this solution absent at demo page).
